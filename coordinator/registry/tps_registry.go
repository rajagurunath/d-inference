// TPSRegistry aggregates observed decode TPS values from heartbeats,
// keyed by model and chip family. Used to provide fleet-calibrated
// estimates for providers that haven't reported observed TPS yet.
//
// It holds two independent sample stores with the same 50-sample FIFO+median
// shape but deliberately different ingest semantics:
//
//   - samples (Record/Median): EVERY reported EWMA, including under-load ones.
//     Feeds fleetMedianTPS → TTFT estimation, whose load-inclusive semantics
//     are intentional (an estimate of what a request will actually see).
//   - soloSamples (RecordSolo/SoloMedian, solo_tps.go): only samples taken
//     while the WHOLE box was uncontended. Feeds the quality-concurrency cap,
//     which needs a static solo rate that cannot collapse under the very
//     overload the cap exists to prevent.
//
// Every read-side aggregate (medians, the cross-class solo aggregate) is
// maintained on write and served as an O(1), allocation-free lookup — see
// tps_median_cache.go. The routing scan reads them once per provider.
