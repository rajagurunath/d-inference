// Servability prediction.
//
// The coordinator's free-memory admission gate (freeMemoryAdmits) is, on the
// COLD path, weight-only: it checks that a model's weights fit a provider's
// reported free_for_load_gb but discards the KV-cache requirement. So a long
// prompt can be admitted onto a provider that can LOAD gpt-oss but whose
// post-load token budget cannot hold (prompt + max_tokens). The provider then
// rejects with token_budget_exhausted / insufficient KV headroom and the request
// fails as a 5xx — an uptime-damaging "admitted_but_failed" (the dominant
// gpt-oss OpenRouter failure mode after TTFT_HARD_REJECT was disabled).
//
// PredictServable answers a narrow, structural question BEFORE we admit/dispatch:
// "is there any provider in the fleet that could ever serve a request of this
// size?" — i.e. does (prompt + max_tokens) fit the model's context window AND
// some provider's structural token budget. When the answer is a confident NO,
// the caller returns an uptime-NEUTRAL early 429 (OpenRouter fails over) instead
// of admit→5xx.
//
// Design invariants:
//   - FAIL OPEN. Whenever the data needed to decide is missing or ambiguous, the
//     verdict is Servable=true. This predictor must never reintroduce the blunt
//     over-rejection of the old global TTFT_HARD_REJECT — it only rejects clearly
//     unservable requests; everything else is left to the normal capacity path
//     and the dispatch-exhausted backstop.
//   - It mirrors the provider gate's two real limits: the model context window
//     and the per-slot token budget. The token-budget tier uses the provider's
//     own reported active_token_budget_max for resident slots and an optimistic
//     cold estimate (see coldTokenBudgetEstimate) for on-disk slots.
//   - STRUCTURAL ONLY. The token-budget tier compares against each provider's
//     budget CEILING, never the live remaining budget (ceiling minus active +
//     queued tokens). A request that fits some ceiling but not the current live
//     headroom is merely arriving on a BUSY fleet — that is transient fullness,
//     owned by the capacity/queue path (queue-before-shed), which holds the
//     request until a slot frees. This gate may 429 only requests that could
//     NEVER be served no matter how long they waited.
//   - The prompt-token input is the routing estimate (len/4), which UNDER-counts
//     real tokens; that is the safe direction here (under-count → less likely to
//     reject), with the dispatch-exhausted reclassification catching whatever the
//     estimate misses.

// This function's only job is to reproduce the PROVIDER's own reserve arithmetic
// for a slot that has no heartbeat yet. It is not an independent opinion about
// how much memory prefill needs. UnifiedMemoryCap.kvBudgetBytes computes
// cap − Σweights − reserve with reserve flat at 5.5 GiB, and a resident slot
// reports exactly that back as active_token_budget_max (EngineV2Bridge+Capacity:
// kvBytesCapacity / kvBytesPerToken) — which snapshotStructuralBudget prefers
// whenever it exists. So the cold estimate has to converge to the warm report as
// the slot loads, and it does, because both are the same subtraction.
//
// That is why there is no attention-posture term here. A composed-attention
// model (gemma-4: head_dim 256 sliding / 512 full) really does materialise a
// bigger prefill score tensor than a fused one (gpt-oss: head_dim 64, inside
// MLX's fused-SDPA set), but the provider does not charge a posture term —
// its reserve is the measured per-model floor (or the flat default), never a
// shape estimate. Charging a term the provider does not hold made this gate
// strictly TIGHTER than the gate it mirrors and 429'd prompts every provider
// in the fleet could have served. Whether a floor is the right number is the
// provider's question, answered in one place; a second opinion here can only
// desync. Retune this ONLY when the provider's floors move — as they did for
// v0.8.0 (3 → 5.5, the measured B=8 activation peak) and again when the
// measured per-model table shipped — and keep the LEGACY constants beside it
// while any pre-move provider remains in the fleet: convergence is
// per-provider, so the mirror must charge each binary the reserve it actually
// holds (servabilityActivationFloor).
//
// Being optimistic is the safe direction because the coordinator is not the

// reservation is checked against real MLX active+cache bytes
