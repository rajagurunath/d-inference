// Package registry manages the set of connected provider agents, their
// capabilities, and routes inference requests to appropriate providers.
//
// The registry is the coordinator's in-memory view of the provider fleet.
// It tracks each provider's hardware, available models, attestation status,
// trust level, and operational state (online/serving/offline/untrusted).
//
// Routing uses round-robin among idle providers that serve the requested
// model. Providers that fail too many attestation challenges are marked
// as untrusted and excluded from routing. Stale providers (no heartbeat
// within the timeout) are evicted by a background goroutine.
//
// Trust levels:
//   - none: Provider did not include an attestation blob
//   - self_signed: Provider's attestation was signed by its own SE key
//   - hardware: MDA certificate chain verified (future, requires Apple
//     Business Manager enrollment)
