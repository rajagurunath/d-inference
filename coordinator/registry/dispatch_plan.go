//
// Prod gap (timeout route rows, 2026-08): failed requests carried
// candidate_count 86-401 with attempt indexes up to 9, yet every retry and
// speculative backup re-scanned the whole fleet from scratch
// (coordinator/api/dispatch.go → ReserveProviderEx). Candidates were never the
// deficit — identity retention was: by the time a retry scanned again, the
// herd had moved, the scan re-ranked the same overloaded boxes, and the
// request burned its first-content budget on rescan after rescan.
//
// The plan retains up to dispatchPlanMaxAlternates of the lowest-cost
// NON-winner candidates from the SAME scan that selected the primary, plus
// full-pool aggregate counts for telemetry. It is strictly request-local
// state: *Provider pointers plus small value snapshots of the ranking terms,
// no registry-side maps, no TTLs, no background reaping — when the request
// ends, the plan is garbage. Consuming an entry later goes through
// ReserveNextFromPlan, which re-verifies identity (the registry must still map
// the entry's provider ID to the exact same *Provider — a reconnect creates a
// new object) and re-runs the FULL admission gate chain via the same helpers
// the scan uses, so a plan entry can never bypass a gate that a fresh scan
