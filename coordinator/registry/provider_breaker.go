// Per-provider (node-health) circuit breaker.
//
// SEPARATE from and ADDITIONAL to the shape-keyed inference-error breaker in
// error_cooldown.go. That breaker is keyed by (provider, model, shape) and only
// counts sickness-shaped 500/502/504 — it deliberately ignores 503 (the
// provider's capacity/lifecycle signal) and resets per shape on success. The
// hole it leaves: a NODE that has gone bad at the box level and returns a
// GENUINE-FAULT 503 (an internal error, a crashed/panicked backend, or the
// opaque Foundation "the operation couldn't be completed" string) for ~100% of
// its requests stays fully routable. Reputation skips 503,
// the dispatch-load cooldown only fires on model-load failures, and within-
// request retry is per-request. Worse, the bad node keeps reporting slot_state
// = idle + a warm model, so the scheduler treats it as an ideal instant-TTFT
// target and keeps feeding it (one box failed 99/99 for 15+ minutes in prod).
//
// This breaker is keyed by NODE only (across every model and shape), via the
// stable fault key (faultKeyForSession: serial/SE-key when attestation has bound
// one, the session id otherwise) so its state survives reconnect churn: a
// node returning faults for ~all requests is sick regardless of cause, so it is
// quarantined fleet-wide, re-probed after an exponential cooldown, and
// auto-re-admitted on the first success.
//
// FAIL OPEN. Capacity-class sheds NEVER count (4xx/429 and a healthy-but-busy
// 5xx — token budget, KV headroom, draining, queue full, …), so load alone can
// never trip it. And when the breaker would deroute EVERY provider for a model
// (e.g. a bad fleet-wide rollout that fault-503s everywhere), selection re-scans
// with the breaker bypassed (see selectBestCandidateLockedFull) so routing can
// never be zeroed out — mirroring servability.go's fail-open philosophy.
//
// State lives on the identity's gateState (gate_state.go) under gate.mu; the
// old opportunistic >1024 map sweep is the periodic gate sweep. The
// transition-bool return mirrors error_cooldown.go.
