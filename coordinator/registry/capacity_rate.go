// Capacity-503 rate penalty — the gray-box derater, the slow half of the
// gray-box fix (see budget_clamp.go for the incident).
//
// A "gray box" fails a material FRACTION of its dispatches with
// capacity-shaped 503s while serving the rest (prod: gemma per-request success
// decayed 57%→25% over 20h on mixed boxes whose heartbeats looked idle). Every
// zero-interleaved-accepts breaker is blind to it by construction: each accept
// resets the pair cooldown streak and the node capacity streak. This tracker
// deliberately has NO accept-triggered reset — that reset IS the blindness
// being fixed. Instead it keeps a sliding window (capacityRateWindow) of
// capacity-503s AND accepts per (stable identity, model) pair and computes
//
//	rate = capacity503s / (capacity503s + accepts)
//
// over the window. When the pair has at least capacityRateMinSample outcomes
// and the rate exceeds capacityRateThreshold, the scheduler adds a cost
// penalty PROPORTIONAL to the rate (rate × EIGENINFERENCE_CAPACITY_RATE_PENALTY_MS,
// default 15000ms) to the pair's candidate in buildCandidateWithReason. A box
// serving 75% fine keeps serving with a mild handicap; a 40%-error box sinks
// well below the near-tie window (nearTieCostWindowMs = 3000) and only
// receives traffic when healthier peers are worse. Nothing is ejected — the
// candidate stays in the pool, so the fail-open selection machinery
// (selectBestCandidateLockedFull) is untouched and a degraded-but-only fleet
// still serves. Outcomes age out of the window naturally, so the penalty
// decays on its own once the 503s stop.
//
// One served request counts as ONE accept outcome: the api layer OFFERS the
// accept at the commit point (first content chunk) and stamps the request when
// the offer records; at clean completion it re-offers only when the commit-time
// offer did not record (!RateOutcomeCountedSafe), which covers paths that never
// commit content. Accepts are retained even before the first reject so a later
// reject burst is measured against every recent served dispatch, not against an
// artificially reject-only window. Commit-recorded XOR completion-recorded, so
// the denominator is per-dispatch honest.
// Rejects are recorded once per failed dispatch attempt by
// RecordCapacityReject.
//
// Keyed by the STABLE fault identity like every sibling tracker: the windows
// live on the identity's gate (gate_state.go), so reconnects cannot reset
// them, they migrate on identity rebind (mergeLocked), Disconnect does NOT
// clear them, and the periodic gate sweep drops fully aged windows. Guarded by
// gate.mu.
