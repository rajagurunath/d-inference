// Heartbeat-triggered queue-drain suppression.
//
// Every heartbeat from a provider re-runs the queue drain for the models it
// serves (Registry.Heartbeat). Fleet-wide that is ~260 passes/s, and under
// saturation each pass costs a full fleet scan (~1 ms / 2 MB at 1,300
// providers) only to re-derive "no candidate". Heartbeats almost never free
// capacity themselves — completions, cancels, failed attempts (SetProviderIdle),
// challenge recoveries (RecordChallengeSuccess), disconnects, and load_model
// completions (DrainQueuedRequestsForModel) do, and those triggers are never
// suppressed. So a heartbeat skips a model whose last drain pass ended in a
// pure capacity/TTFT rejection less than heartbeatDrainSuppressWindow ago.

// heartbeatDrainSuppressWindow bounds how soon after a saturated drain pass a
// HEARTBEAT may trigger another pass for the same model. A suppressed
// heartbeat is not dropped: it arms ONE trailing pass at the end of the
// window, so capacity that only a heartbeat could have revealed (a
// budget-clamp release proof, a lower active-token report replacing the
// pessimistic pending ledger) is drained at most 20 ms late rather than
// waiting for the next un-suppressed trigger (the next heartbeat is 5 s
// away). Every other trigger drains at once.
