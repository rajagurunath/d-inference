// Quality-concurrency admission cap.
//
// The legacy per-provider concurrency cap is a flat 24 (maxConcurrency, for
// token-budget providers) — a hard-coded approximation of "how many concurrent
// decodes a backend can run before per-request TPS collapses". That single
// number is wrong for slow models: a 26B model that decodes ~23 tok/s solo
// drops below the 15 tok/s quality floor at a batch of 2, yet the flat cap let
// it accept up to 24 concurrent, collapsing every stream to a few tok/s and
// triggering cancellations.
//
// This computes the ceiling per provider+model from the model's batch-
// degradation curve instead — the same rate(B) = solo/(1+k·B) model the
// warm-pool target math uses (qualityConcurrency in warm_pool_target.go) — so
// admission and capacity planning cannot drift. Slow models get a tight cap;
// fast / over-provisioned models keep the flat fallback (their quality batch is
// already at or above it). The cap is computed from the provider's STATIC
// single-stream decode rate (resolvedDecodeTPS), NEVER the observed-under-load
// EWMA: the observed rate collapses under the very overload this cap exists to
// prevent, which would force the cap to 1 — a feedback loop.
//
// Raising a backend's own concurrency ceiling therefore buys NOTHING on its
// own. The provider-reported number is only the `base` operand of the MIN
// below; the resolved per-model SOLO RATE decides. Inverting the cap math, a
// provider is granted its full reported N only above
//
//	q    = floor((N-1)/overcommit) + 1     # smallest quality batch whose
//	                                       # ceil(q·overcommit) still reaches N
//	solo >= floor · (1 + k·q)              # N=8, floor 15, overcommit 1.2:
//	                                       #   39.3 tok/s at k=0.27
//	                                       #   50.1 tok/s at k=0.39
//
// and a model whose resolved rate sits under that gets the quality batch, not
// the bump. The rate is what needs fixing when a bump does not land — usually
// by seeding it (modelSoloTPSSeedEnv), because solo sampling is gated on a
// fully uncontended box (soloSampleEligible) and a model that is BUSY at the
// new concurrency never produces another sample. See
// TestQualityCapReachesProviderReportedConcurrency for the pinned relationship.

// defaultQualityCapOvercommit is the effective overcommit when the operator has
// not set EIGENINFERENCE_QUALITY_CONCURRENCY_OVERCOMMIT. The legacy 2.0 diluted
// per-request decode to roughly HALF the quality floor at full admission
// (rate(cap) → floor/overcommit under rate(B) = solo/(1+k·B)): production
// measured gemma-4-26b at p50 8 tok/s against the 15 tok/s floor, with 81% of
// successful requests below it. 1.2 bounds the dilution at ~floor/1.2 — the

//     cross-class transfer, SoloMedianAllChips), same total-sample floor, and
//     only when that minimum is actually BOUNDED for this provider — see
//     "when cross-class transfer is admissible" below;
//  3. the same-class solo median with FEWER than qualityCapSoloMinSamples
//     samples (but at least one), then the bounded cross-class median under
//     the same relaxation. These are under-sampled but they are still
//     MEASURED and still solo-gated, and the alternative below them is a
//     model-AGNOSTIC hardware proxy: preferring sqrt(memory_bandwidth) over
//     the provider's own measurement of this exact model is strictly worse
//     information. See the note on convergence below;
//  4. the modelSoloTPSSeedEnv seed for this provider's chip class when there
//     is no measured rate at all — the class-qualified entry, else the
//     fleet-wide entry clamped to the slowest class the operator named
//     (soloTPSSeedForClass). The TPS registry is in-memory and restart-wiped,
//     and a provider that has completed no request reports no rate (see
//     below);
//  5. the provider-level resolvedDecodeTPS(p) — exactly the pre-per-model
//     behavior, including its sqrt-bandwidth fallback semantics.
//
// When cross-class transfer is admissible. Steps (2) and (3) hand a provider a
// rate its own chip class did not produce, so the transferred value needs an
// upper bound or a fast class silently sets a slow class's cap — the exact
// over-admission this whole cap exists to prevent. Three things can supply
// that bound, and at least one MUST hold:
//
//   - a modelSoloTPSSeedEnv seed applies to THIS provider's chip class
//     (soloTPSSeedForClass) — the configured cold-start estimate clamps the
//     transfer from above;
//   - the provider's own class contributed at least one sample, so the min of
//     per-class medians cannot exceed what its own class demonstrated;
//   - at least two classes contributed. This one is WEAKER than it looks and
//     is not a bound on the destination: the min over {M4 Max, M3 Max} is
//     still a Max-tier rate, and handing it to an unsampled M1 Pro over-states
//     that box by 4x. It is admitted anyway because it is a partial brake —
//     refusing it drops to (4)/(5), and resolvedDecodeTPS is usually FASTER
//     than the cross-class min (a mixed box benchmarked on gpt-oss reads 93
//     tok/s), so refusing would LOOSEN the cap in most fleet shapes rather
//     than tighten it. Measured: over 600 shapes where this arm is the sole
//     admission reason, refusing loosens 338, tightens 81, no change in 181.
//     soloTransferDestBoundLocked below supplies the bound this arm lacks.
//
// With none of them, the "min of per-class medians" is a single fast class's
// rate being applied to an unsampled slower one — one M4 Max sample setting an
// unseeded M1 Pro's rate. That is refused: the resolver drops to (4)/(5),
// which is the pre-per-model behaviour and errs toward serving rather than
// toward capping a box from evidence about different hardware.
//
// Reachability note for whoever edits crossClassBounded next: the third arm
// cannot fire on the current production fleet. The shipped
// EIGENINFERENCE_MODEL_SOLO_TPS_SEED carries UNQUALIFIED entries for both
// served models ("gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit=14,gpt-oss-20b=30"), and an unqualified
// entry resolves through modelSoloTPSSeedFleet for EVERY chip class, so
// hasSeed is true fleet-wide and the first arm always short-circuits it. The
// arm is live only for a model added without an unqualified seed entry.
// TestSoloSeedUnqualifiedEntryMakesEveryClassSeeded pins that.
//
// What a provider reports BEFORE its first completion: nothing. The bridge's
// EWMA (EngineV2Bridge.observedDecodeTpsEwma) is 0 until updateDecodeTpsEwma
// runs on a terminal event, `observed_decode_tps` is `omitempty`, and the
// heartbeat ingest only calls RecordSolo when the reported value is > 0
// (registry.go). So a fresh provider contributes NO solo sample, reaches (4)
// or (5), and is never capped at 1 by its own silence. Steps (3) can only
// engage once a real decode has been measured.
//
// Under-sampled samples converge from BELOW, which is the safe direction. The
// bridge EWMA (alpha = 0.3) blends prior batched decodes, so the first sample
// taken as the box drops to a single running request UNDER-states the true
// solo rate; it can never materially over-state it (solo is the fastest case,
// and the ingest path already clamps to maxDecodeTPS). An under-stated rate
// yields a TIGHTER cap, never a permissive one.
//
// The rate is deliberately STATIC (never an under-load EWMA): an observed rate
// collapses under the very overload the cap exists to prevent, which would
// drive the cap to 1 in a feedback loop. Solo medians preserve that property
// because ingest is gated on a fully uncontended box.
