// gate_state.go — per-identity routing-gate state.
//
// Every fault tracker that gates routing — the node-health breaker
// (provider_breaker.go), stable-identity health ejection (health_ejection.go),
// the shape-keyed inference-error cooldown (error_cooldown.go), the capacity
// cooldown / rate window / budget clamp (capacity_cooldown.go, capacity_rate.go,
// budget_clamp.go) and the dispatch-load cooldown (registry.go) — used to live
// in global maps guarded by Registry.mu. Recording an outcome therefore took
// the registry WRITE lock: six times per served request, each acquisition
// draining the whole batch of fleet-scan readers first (~190 ms in prod). The
// holders were microseconds; the wait was structural.
//
// The state now lives in one gateState per fault key with its own mutex.
// Recorders resolve the gate, take gate.mu, mutate, release — they never touch
// r.mu. The scan reads the two hot booleans (breaker open, ejected) from
// atomics and takes gate.mu only for providers that actually carry per-model
// state (a flag word says which), so the common per-provider cost is a few
// atomic loads.
//
// LOCK ORDER: r.mu → p.mu → r.gatesMu → gate.mu. Never acquire r.mu or p.mu
// while holding gatesMu or a gate.mu. Recorders normally take gatesMu for
// READING (session → gate resolution); first insertion and the rare exhausted
// retry in lockGateWithIndex take it for writing. Register, Disconnect, the
// attestation-time identity bind (under the session's p.mu) and the periodic
// sweep also write the index. Only the identity
// migration (migrateGateLocked, under gatesMu.Lock) ever holds two gate.mu at
// once, so there is no ordering problem between gates. There is deliberately
// NO walk-wide gates lock on the scan: a lock taken for the whole fleet walk
// with per-completion writers would rebuild the exact convoy this removes.
//
// A recorder resolves its gate under gatesMu.RLock and locks it AFTER letting
// go of gatesMu, so the index can change in between: the identity bind can
// move the session to another gate, the sweep can drop the gate. The
// map-keyed implementation had no such window (key resolution and the write
// shared one r.mu.Lock section), so lockGate re-establishes it: after
// acquiring gate.mu it checks that the gate is still the one the outcome
// belongs to (not retired, still the session's cached gate) and otherwise
// releases, re-resolves through the index and retries. Everything that can
// invalidate a resolved gate — the forward, the retire flag, the session's
// repoint — is therefore written while holding that gate's mu. The routing
// READS are covered two ways. A rebind runs under the session's p.mu
// (bindStableFaultKey's callers hold it), so a read made under p.mu — the
// scan's gate chain, the reservation commit from its admit re-check through
// the pending debit, the alias resolver's routability read — never sees
// p.gate move mid-section. Independently of that lock, every read that feeds
// a dispatch decision confirms its verdict against p.gate afterwards and
// re-reads from the session's new gate when it moved (gateView,
// gate_index.go); that is what covers the candidate cost read the scan makes
// after it has released p.mu.
//
// Sections under gate.mu must stay per identity and microseconds long.
//
// The implementation is split by concern:
//
//	gate_state.go       — this header, the gateState struct, its lock-free view
//	                      (publishLocked and the atomic readers)
//	gate_index.go       — the registry-side index (r.gates / r.sessions under
//	                      gatesMu), session → gate resolution, attach/detach
//	gate_migrate.go     — identity binds and the state migration (forwards,
//	                      merge and reset policy)
//	gate_sweep.go       — the per-gate prune and the periodic index sweep
//	gate_lock.go        — the recorders' validated lock (lockGate), the
//	                      lock-free flag fast path and the wait observer
//	gate_commit_mode.go — the EIGENINFERENCE_RESERVE_COMMIT_MODE kill switch

// Bits of gateState.pairFlags: which per-model trackers hold ANY entry for this
// identity. Published under gate.mu after every mutation; read lock-free by the
// scan so a provider with no per-model state costs no lock section at all.
