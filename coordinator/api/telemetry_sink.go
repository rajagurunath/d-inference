// Non-blocking, batching sink for best-effort routing-telemetry persistence.
//
// Routing telemetry (inference-route records, outcome updates, rejection ledger
// rows) is observability data: useful, but it must NEVER add latency or
// backpressure to inference, and it must never let a slow/unavailable store
// (Postgres) grow goroutines or memory without bound. Previously each telemetry
// write was persisted with its own saferun.Go(...) goroutine — one goroutine per
// write. When the store fell behind, those goroutines (each pinning the captured
// record) piled up unboundedly.
//
// telemetrySink is a single bounded, non-blocking queue: the request path
// enqueues an op (which never blocks), ONE long-lived worker drains the queue,
// and when the buffer is full the write is DROPPED and counted. Goroutines and
// memory are therefore bounded by construction, and inference latency is fully
// decoupled from store latency.
//
// Ops are TYPED so the worker can coalesce them: it gathers up to maxBatch ops
// (waiting at most window for more), writes every route record in the group
// with ONE multi-row store call and every run of outcome updates with ONE
// pipelined call, and runs generic closures (rejections) inline at their queue
// position. See telemetry_sink_batch.go for the ordering argument.
//
// Shutdown: close marks the sink closed (later submits are rejected and
// counted as drops) and signals the worker, which finishes its group, writes
// whatever was buffered at that instant, and exits. closeAndWait bounds how
// long a caller waits for that final drain; Server.Close uses it so the rows
// are flushed before the process closes the database pool.
