// Domain sub-interfaces composed into Store (see interface.go).
//
// Store was a ~150-method god-interface that forced parallel memory.go /
// postgres.go implementations and gave callers no way to depend on a narrow
// slice of the persistence surface. It is split here into cohesive,
// single-domain sub-interfaces; Store embeds all of them, so the full method
// set — and both implementations — are unchanged. The split is purely
// organizational: every method keeps its exact signature and semantics.
