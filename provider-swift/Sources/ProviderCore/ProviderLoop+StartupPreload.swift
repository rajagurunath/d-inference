/// ProviderLoop -- boot-time model preload + registration readiness gate.
///
/// Fixes the v0.6.30-class cold-restart failure mode: the provider used to
/// register (and attract routing) immediately after a release restart with
/// NOTHING loaded, so the first requests paid the full multi-GB weight load
/// and engine build inside a live request — and at a fleet rollover every box
/// was cold at once (first_chunk_timeout storm).
///
/// Now `run()` calls `runStartupPreloadGate()` BEFORE the coordinator client
/// is created: the previously-served (or operator-configured) model set is
/// loaded via the normal `ensureModelLoaded` path (weights + EngineV2 bridge),
/// optionally followed by a 1-token greedy
/// decode through the real serving path so Metal JIT, compiled buckets, and
/// the chat-template render are warm before the first routed request.
///
/// **Readiness vs availability tradeoff.** Registration is deferred only up
/// to `startup_preload_timeout_secs` (default 120s). If a load exceeds it,
/// the provider registers anyway — a lone provider for a model must still
/// serve it cold, and the existing lazy-load path is unchanged as the
/// fallback — while the remaining preloads continue in the background. The
/// heartbeat's `warm_models` field (which the coordinator's warm-model bonus
/// scores) stays truthful throughout: it is derived from live slots only, so
/// a still-loading model is never advertised as warm.
