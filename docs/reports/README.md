# Reports — dated records

> Last updated: 2026-09-05 · commit `9611f8771`

Frozen records: incident analyses, measurements, experiment results, and
migration records. Each file describes the code **as it was on its date**; none
is edited after it lands, and none describes the current system. For how things
work today read [`../architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md); for
what was decided and whether it shipped read [`../design/README.md`](../design/README.md).

File names start with the date of the work (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`). Each file's
freshness stamp carries its own date, not the current one.
