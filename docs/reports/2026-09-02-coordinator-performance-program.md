# Coordinator performance program — 2026-09-02

> Last updated: 2026-09-02 · commit `5508b4f84`

Status: complete, awaiting review/push (branch `worktree-bridge-cse_01TuyfD42fkRyG4ZqSTmeN4U`, based on master `a1f51ea4c`).

This report is the first-principles pass over every coordinator operation with a
measurable cost: the inference hot path (auth → parse → admit → route → dispatch →
stream → settle), the fleet-scale paths (heartbeats, eviction, aggregates), and
the store layer. Each finding names the mechanism, the measured cost, and the
change made. Numbers are from `coordinator/registry/fleet_scale_bench_test.go`
(1,260 providers, 15 models, live heartbeats, in-flight pending requests) on an
Apple M4 Max unless stated otherwise.

## 1. Why now

The 2026-09-01 congestion collapse (PR #799) showed the coordinator's per-request
CPU cost is dominated by full-fleet walks: every request scans all ~1,260
providers at least twice (capacity preflight + reservation scan), and the failure
path re-scans up to 64 times. PR #799 bounds the retry ladder and adds a scan
semaphore; this program attacks the cost of each scan and of everything else on
the request path.

## 2. Baseline (before)

| Benchmark | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FleetReserveProviderEx (scan + commit + release) | 403,844 | 186,309 | 824 |
| FleetReserveProviderExParallel (GOMAXPROCS=16) | 355,349 | 231,610 | 1,027 |
| FleetQuickCapacityCheck (preflight) | 151,308 | 80,976 | 672 |
| FleetHeartbeat (ingest) | 529 | 449 | 6 |
| FleetListModels (`/v1/models` aggregate) | 180,489 | 249,272 | 1,281 |

CPU profile of the reservation scan (top of `pprof -top`):

| Share | Where | Mechanism |
|---:|---|---|
| 35% | `runtime.walltime` | `time.Now()` per provider — `snapshotProviderLockedEx` calls it before any gate, so all 1,260 providers pay it even though ~90% do not advertise the model |
| 8.5% | `runtime.duffcopy` | `routingSnapshot` (large struct) copied by value through snapshot → candidate → discount |
| 3% | `healthEjectionEnabled` | `os.Getenv` + `ToLower`/`TrimSpace` per provider per scan |
| 3.5% | `prefixCacheV2CapabilitiesForModel` | second full fleet walk per request, `p.mu` on every provider, run even with cache routing off |
| ~2% | `slices.pdqsort` | `TPSRegistry.Median` copies + sorts up to 50 samples per provider |
| ~2% | `runtime.concatstrings` | `providerID + ":" + model` map keys for every cooldown/breaker/clamp gate |
| ~4% (alloc) | `versionSegments` / `strings.Split` | semver re-parsed per provider per scan |

Allocation profile: `buildCandidateWithReason` 44% (one heap candidate with an
embedded snapshot copy per eligible provider), `TPSRegistry.Median` 23%,
`providerPooledTokenBudgetWithLayout` 11% (a map per provider per snapshot).

End-to-end (`EIGENINFERENCE_PERF_E2E=1 go test ./api/ -run TestPerfE2E`; real HTTP,
in-process WebSocket fake providers answering instantly, memory store, 16 KB
bodies, 40 streamed chunks):

| Fleet | Concurrency | Throughput | TTFB p50 / p95 | Total p50 / p95 |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 100 providers | 16 | 1,523 req/s | 6.8 ms / 9.7 ms | 10.2 ms / 14.0 ms |
| 1,000 providers | 32 | 524 req/s | 42.3 ms / 54.7 ms | 62.1 ms / 83.0 ms |

Ten times the fleet costs six times the first-byte latency with providers that
respond instantly: the per-request fleet walk is the coordinator's dominant
cost at production scale.

## 3. Hot-path inventory (per chat completion, success path)

| Stage | Cost mechanism | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `requireAuth` | API key cached (60s) but `GetUserByAccountID` is a Postgres round trip on every request | uncached |
| `parseInferencePrelude` + `handleChatCompletions` | body parsed once, then re-marshalled/re-parsed 6–9× (tool-constraint validation re-parses the original body; alias/reasoning/defaults/max_tokens each re-marshal; `providerBodyForModel` recomputed for the same model) | CPU + allocs proportional to body size, up to MBs with inline media |
| `GetModelRegistryRecord` | two queries per call, called 3–4× per request | uncached |
| `reserveInferenceBalance` | one round trip | necessary |
| `runInferenceAdmission` | `QuickCapacityCheck` full fleet walk | see §2 |
| `ReserveProviderEx` | full fleet walk + global write-lock commit | see §2 |
| `recordRoutingDecisionFor` | one INSERT per attempt through a 1-worker, 4096-deep sink | write amplification, drops under a slow DB |
| streaming relay | one `Fprintf` + `Flush` (syscall) per token; seven `strings.Contains` per chunk | per-token syscalls |
| `handleCompleteAt` | `GetUserByAccountID` again, three separate credit transactions, usage insert | 4–6 round trips per completion |

Fleet-scale: `Registry.Heartbeat` is cheap (0.5 µs); the API-side heartbeat
branch adds capacity deep-copies and telemetry; `ListModels` re-aggregates the
fleet on every `/v1/models`; `/v1/stats` is cached, other public endpoints are
not.

## 4. Changes

_(per worker, in merge order)_

### 4.1 Store read-through cache (`store/cached.go`, `store/cached_domain.go`, `store/cached_clone.go`)

`store.NewCached` wraps both backends at construction in `cmd/coordinator/main.go`.
It overrides only the hot-path lookups and the mutators that can change them:

| Cached lookup | TTL | Invalidated by |
|---|---|---|
| `GetUserByAccountID`, `GetUserByPrivyID` | 30 s | `CreateUser`, `SetUserRole`, `SetUserPlatformFeePercent`, `SetUserStripeAccount` (whole user domain) |
| `GetModelRegistryRecord`, `GetModelManifest` | 10 s | every model-registry writer (whole model domain) |
| "not found" results | 5 s | same |

Reads return deep copies, a generation counter drops loads that raced a
write, domains are bounded (10k users, 1k models) with random eviction, and
transient DB errors are never cached. Effect: the per-request `requireAuth`
user lookup and the 3–4 registry-record lookups (two queries each) become
in-memory hits after the first request per key/model. Single-process
assumption documented in the file header; TTLs bound staleness from
out-of-band SQL edits.

Decorating the store hides backend-only capabilities that callers discover by
type assertion (`codeAttestPushBudgetStore`, `verificationDuePageStore`), which
would have silently downgraded APNs push-budget durability and verification-job
pagination. `store.As[T]` walks `Unwrap()` through decorators and the four
assertion sites use it; tests pin that both capabilities survive the wrap.
Cache counters are emitted as `store.cache.*` gauges per domain.


### 4.2 Routing scan (`registry/`)

Ten commits, all inside `registry/`, each measured on the fleet benchmark:

| Step | Mechanism | Reserve ns/op (min) |
|---|---|---:|
| baseline | | 372k |
| clock hoist | one `time.Now()` per walk (scan, preflight, `PredictServable`, commit) | 262k |
| TPS caches | `Median`/`SoloMedian`/`SoloMedianAllChips` maintained on `Record` (≤50 samples), O(1) zero-alloc reads | 221k |
| kill switch + hint skip | health-ejection env read once at init (test hook); cache-capability walk skipped when hints are impossible (tracker nil / mode off / no plan) | 202k |
| version memo + struct keys | semver segments memoized (bounded 256, reset-on-full); `{providerID, model}` keys for dispatch-load cooldowns and pending loads | 176k |
| in-place snapshots | snapshot filled in place, `buildCandidateInto`, chunked `candidateArena`, pointer-passing (no `duffcopy`) | 135k |
| per-model index | `providersForModelLocked`: advertised model → providers, maintained at every `p.Models` mutation and removal site; used by the reservation scan, preflight, `PredictServable`, cache-capability lookup, and the alias probes (2–8 walks per aliased request) | 103k |
| calibrator bound | TTFT calibrator no longer re-sweeps its pending map on every reservation at capacity | 68k |

Eligibility gates are unchanged; the index only prunes providers that cannot
advertise the model. Review follow-ups landed with it: the health-ejection
test hook moved out of the production file; the calibrator prefers expired
entries at capacity (bounded probe plus a 5 s capacity sweep); a fault-state
fixture pins index equivalence with breaker-open, health-ejected and
capacity-cooled providers; the TPS median cache is safe for a zero-value
registry; the version memo skips oversized keys and the accepted provider
version is capped at 64 bytes at registration (provider-controlled input must
not be retained unbounded). Tests pin index == brute-force walk after every mutation
type and identical routing results with/without the index on the 1,260-provider
fixture for plain/tools/vision/TTFT-ceiling shapes.

### 4.3 Route telemetry batching (`api/telemetry_sink*.go`, `store/*route_telemetry*.go`)

The routing-telemetry sink now queues typed operations (route record, outcome
update, closure) and one worker gathers up to 256 ops or 100 ms, writing the
group's records with one multi-row `INSERT … ON CONFLICT`
(`RecordInferenceRoutes`) and each run of outcome updates with one pgx batch
pipeline (`UpdateInferenceRouteOutcomes`). A tracer-backed Postgres test shows
50 records + 50 updates go from 100 statements to 1 statement + 1 pipeline.
Per-key insert → update order is preserved by opening a new group whenever a
record's key already appears in the current group; the non-blocking
drop-and-count contract, single worker (now enforced), panic isolation per
row, transient-error classification (`store.IsTransientWriteError`: no
per-row replay on deadline/connection errors), post-close rejection, and a
bounded 2 s flush in `Server.Close` before the pool closes are all covered by
tests on both backends.

Settlement consolidation (one transaction for the consumer refund, provider
earning and platform fee) was evaluated and **not shipped**: the three writes
fail independently today, `CreditProviderAccount` is idempotent on job id
while `Credit` is not, and a single transaction over three balance rows adds a
deadlock cycle between concurrent settlements. Instead, `Credit` and
`CreditWithdrawable` were collapsed from five round trips (BEGIN, upsert,
SELECT, INSERT, COMMIT) to one data-modifying CTE statement, the shape `Debit`
already used; the transactional callers (`CreditWithdrawableOnce`,
`CreditProviderWallet`) reuse the same statement inside their transactions. A
tracer-backed test replays the legacy five-statement sequence against the new
path and asserts byte-identical ledger rows and balances for unknown, existing,
zero and negative amounts; a 32-goroutine mixed Credit/Debit test asserts the
ledger running sums.

### 4.4 Streaming relay and public read endpoints (`api/stream_coalesce.go`, `api/chat_stream_relay.go`, `api/sse_normalize_gate.go`, `api/models_cache.go`)

All three relays (chat, Responses, generic completions/messages) now drain the
chunks already queued in `ChunkCh` after each receive (bounded by the channel
capacity, never waiting), apply the identical per-chunk transforms and holds
in order, and flush once. Goldens pinned against the pre-change byte stream:

| Relay | flushes/op (200-chunk burst) | bytes/op |
|---|---:|---:|
| chat | 203 → 9 | identical |
| responses | 208 → 9 | identical |
| completions | 202 → 8 | identical |
| messages | 205 → 9 | identical |

The relay also fixed two latent ordering bugs the reviewers surfaced: queued
chunks now always precede a concurrently-ready in-band error, and the
Responses/generic close paths report a buffered provider error instead of
"provider ended without completion".

`normalizeSSEChunk` decides with one pass instead of nine `strings.Contains`
scans: content delta 915 → 191 ns, usage chunk 1.1 µs → 155 ns, byte-identical
output over a 36-case differential corpus.

Public read endpoints newly served from the TTL read cache: `/v1/models` and
`/v1/models/{id}` (2 s, shared entry memo keyed by include_builds; self-route
views stay live), `/v1/models/openrouter` (5 s), `/v1/providers/attestation`
(2 s). Admin alias/registry mutations invalidate the catalog-derived entries
through `SyncModelCatalog`/`SyncModelAliases`, so the TTLs only bound
out-of-band edits.

### 4.5 Fleet-scale aggregate and periodic paths (`registry/registry.go` ListModels/evictStale, `registry/provider_snapshot.go`)

| Path | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| `ListModels` (`/v1/models` aggregate) | 182 µs, 1,281 allocs | 115 µs, 19 allocs |
| `PublicProviderModels` (`/v1/stats`, `/v1/providers/attestation`) | 181 µs, 1,266 allocs | 144 µs, 7 allocs |
| `evictStale` (every 30 s) | full fleet walk under the registry **write** lock (~85 µs, stalls routing readers) | walk under the read lock; write lock only to install a changed strike map |

New benchmarks cover every aggregate and periodic walk (`fleet_scale_aggregate_bench_test.go`,
`provider_heartbeat_bench_test.go`). Findings left for follow-up: the
model-swap planner runs a fleet walk on every heartbeat while the queue is
non-empty (~350 µs per heartbeat from a provider advertising a queued model,
~9% of a core at 250 heartbeats/s per queued model). Fixed in the registry
follow-up (`registry/model_swap_coalesce.go`): heartbeats now admit at most
one swap plan per 250 ms fleet-wide (the api cold-dispatch kick still plans
immediately), the planner's two walks iterate the per-model index, and the
per-heartbeat drain is unchanged — a direct plan with a queued unservable
model went from 82 µs to 0.2 µs and the full heartbeat ingest in that state
from 88 µs to 4 µs. Three read-only getters that took the write lock
(`CodeAttestationEnforced` in the 15 s gauge loop) now take the read lock;
`recordMLXCacheTelemetry` emits nine `provider_id`-tagged gauges per heartbeat
(~11k Datadog series per flush — an observability cardinality decision, not
changed here); throttled provider persistence is ~126 DB writes/s fleet-wide
(a product freshness choice, not changed).

### 4.6 Request body pipeline (`api/inference_preprocess.go`, `api/provider_body_*.go`, `api/toolschema_parsed.go`, `api/json_encoded_len.go`)

The chat handler now parses the body once, mutates the map (alias, stop
normalization, runtime defaults, max_tokens bound, reasoning policy, metadata
strip) behind a dirty flag, and serializes once at the first byte consumer.
Tool-schema normalization and tool-constraint validation run on the parsed
map (the legacy `"tools"` byte gate is preserved so escaped keys still pass
verbatim); the five message-tree walks are fused into one; billing bytes are
counted with a JSON-encoded-length routine instead of a full marshal; the
per-model provider body is memoized per request; and the legacy cache-bust
size/seal is computed by arithmetic splice on already-canonical bodies.

Full-body operations per request (chat, alias + runtime defaults, no
`max_tokens`): parses 5 → 1, marshals 10 → 1. With tools on the Responses
surface: parses 11 → 4, marshals up to 16 → 3.

| Body | Helper-level ns/op | HTTP end-to-end ns/op | allocs (HTTP) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 KB chat | 99,418 → 22,360 | 492,662 → 445,907 | 1,290 → 801 |
| 60 KB history | 2,744,618 → 542,521 | 4,306,086 → 1,724,408 | 3,482 → 1,412 |
| 60 KB history + tools | 3,454,648 → 652,058 | 4,825,177 → 1,857,896 | 7,047 → 2,189 |
| 3 MB inline image | 147,274,823 → 19,902,326 | 193,711,639 → 53,986,076 | 1,854 → 972 |

Provider-visible bytes are pinned by identity tests against independent
oracles for every rewrite (verbatim passthrough, alias, stop, max_tokens,
runtime defaults, reasoning on/off, stripped fields, tool normalization,
Responses lowering, protocol-0 seal, alias-capacity fallback on both
surfaces, media inlining), plus property tests for the encoded-length and
splice routines against the decode → re-encode reference.

## 5. After

Registry benchmarks (1,260 providers; baseline and after measured back to back
in the same machine state, load average ~13):

| Benchmark | Before ns/op | After ns/op | allocs/op before → after |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| FleetReserveProviderEx | 322,881 | 67,933–73,309 | 824 → 21 |
| FleetReserveProviderExParallel | 355,349 (quiet baseline) | 84,749–87,103 | 1,027 → 20 |
| FleetQuickCapacityCheck | 151,054 | 47,347–47,922 | 672 → 1 |
| FleetPredictServable (new) | 187,760 (worker A/B) | 43,302–43,530 | 672 → 1 |
| FleetListModels | 191,167 | 138,012–139,786 | 1,281 → 19 |
| FleetHeartbeat | 529 | 641–662 | 6 → 6 (TPS caches now maintained on write) |
| FleetTickTriggerModelSwapsUnservableQueued | 82,390 | 216 | 3 → 3 |
| FleetTickHeartbeatQueuedColdAdvertised | 87,884 | 4,047 | 12 → 9 |

End-to-end (real HTTP, in-process WebSocket fake providers, memory store;
baseline and after measured back to back, same machine state):

| Scenario | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| 100 providers, 16 KB, 16 concurrent | 1,435 req/s, TTFB p50 7.3 ms / p95 10.1 ms | 1,871 req/s, TTFB p50 4.3 ms / p95 7.5 ms |
| 1,000 providers, 16 KB, 32 concurrent | 448 req/s, TTFB p50 44.3 ms / p95 64.5 ms | 954 req/s, TTFB p50 20.4 ms / p95 29.1 ms |
| 100 providers, 60 KB, 16 concurrent | 395 req/s, TTFB p50 16.1 ms / p95 126.6 ms | 1,377 req/s, TTFB p50 7.6 ms / p95 10.8 ms |
| 1,000 providers, 60 KB, 32 concurrent | 410 req/s, TTFB p50 56.9 ms / p95 86.5 ms | 717 req/s, TTFB p50 28.5 ms / p95 46.5 ms |

The memory store hides the database wins: in production each request also
loses one `users` round trip and three to four two-query `model_registry`
round trips (now cache hits), each completion loses three round trips in the
`Credit` collapse, and route telemetry goes from one statement per attempt to
one multi-row insert per 100 ms.

Request preprocessing alone (helper-level benchmark, `-benchtime 2s`): 2 KB
body 99 µs → 22 µs; 60 KB history 2.74 ms → 0.54 ms; 3 MB inline image
147 ms → 20 ms.

## 6. Not done / recommendations

- **Settlement consolidation** (one transaction for refund + provider earning +
  platform fee) was evaluated and not shipped — see §4.3. The `Credit`
  round-trip collapse captures most of the DB win without changing failure
  semantics.
- **`/v1/pricing`** is still uncached (handler lives in `billing_handlers.go`);
  wrap it in the read cache with a 2 s TTL like the other public endpoints.
- **Datadog cardinality**: `recordMLXCacheTelemetry` emits nine gauges tagged
  by `provider_id` on every heartbeat (~11k series per flush at fleet scale).
  Aggregating by chip family, or sampling, is an observability decision worth
  making before the fleet grows further.
- **Provider persistence**: throttled `UpsertProvider`/`TouchProviderSession`/
  `UpsertReputation` writes are ~126 statements/s fleet-wide at 30 s freshness.
  Batching them (multi-row upserts on a 5 s cadence) would cut DB write load
  without changing the freshness contract.
- **Container GC settings**: the container runs with no `GOMEMLIMIT`/`GOGC`
  (deploy/gcp/vm-startup.sh); a soft memory limit tuned to the VM would let
  the GC run less often under the allocation rates measured here. Deploy-side
  change, human-only.
- **pprof listener**: PR #799 adds `EIGENINFERENCE_PPROF_ADDR`; not
  duplicated here. The generic completions/messages handlers still call
  `resolveRequestedModel` (inside #799's hunks) and can be folded onto the
  parse-once path after #799 merges.
- **Review coverage**: every worker slice had both a Codex and an independent
  Claude review; the merged branch had both as well. The Codex leg for the
  final registry batch (planner coalescing, memo bounds, walk clock) was
  launched but its result never came back through the wrapper; that batch
  carries the independent Claude review (PASS) only.
- **Not exercised here**: the system-level `e2e/` integration suite (needs a
  Swift provider binary and a downloaded model) and a real Datadog agent.
- **Swap-planner coalescing window**: a request enqueued right after a plan
  waits up to 250 ms for the next heartbeat-triggered plan (the api
  cold-dispatch kick still plans immediately); on a fleet with no heartbeats at
  all no plan runs, which only matters for single-provider dev setups.
