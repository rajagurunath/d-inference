# Darkbloom documentation

> Last updated: 2026-09-04 · commit `da6db27f2`

> Darkbloom is a decentralized private-inference network: an OpenAI- and
> Anthropic-compatible HTTP API served by a Go coordinator that routes each
> request, re-encrypted per request, to an attested Apple Silicon Mac running
> the Swift `darkbloom` provider, which runs the model in-process with MLX.
> These pages describe the system as the code at the stamped commit implements
> it; the code wins every disagreement. Each page has one job (how-to, runbook,
> reference, explanation, design record, or dated report) and carries a
> freshness stamp. Rules for reading and writing them:
> [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). One name for each thing: [`glossary.md`](glossary.md).

## Start here, by task

- [`consumer/quickstart.md`](consumer/quickstart.md): make your first chat completion with an API key, curl, or an OpenAI/Anthropic SDK by changing the base URL.
- [`provider/installation.md`](provider/installation.md) then [`provider/quickstart.md`](provider/quickstart.md): turn a Mac into a paid provider node.
- [`developer/build.md`](developer/build.md) then [`developer/test.md`](developer/test.md): build and test every component locally.
- [`operations/README.md`](operations/README.md): deploy or change production (human approval required for every mutation).
- [`architecture/overview.md`](architecture/overview.md): understand the whole system in one page.
- [`architecture/security/encryption.md`](architecture/security/encryption.md): the exact, hop-by-hop privacy model — the only page that states it.

## How the system works (explanation)

- [`architecture/overview.md`](architecture/overview.md): components, trust boundaries, and the request path end to end.
- [`architecture/data-flow.md`](architecture/data-flow.md): one request from consumer HTTP through routing, encryption, the provider WebSocket, and back as SSE.
- [`architecture/components/coordinator.md`](architecture/components/coordinator.md): the Go control plane — process layout, HTTP/WebSocket servers, store, background jobs.
- [`architecture/components/provider.md`](architecture/components/provider.md): the Swift provider process — binaries, `ProviderCore` components, process boundaries, what stays in-process.
- [`architecture/components/consumer.md`](architecture/components/consumer.md): the coordinator's OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible request pipeline, stage by stage — parsing, admission, routing, sealing, streaming, settlement.
- [`architecture/components/console-ui.md`](architecture/components/console-ui.md): the Next.js console — pages, `/api/*` relay handlers, Privy auth, SSE chat.
- [`architecture/components/admin-ui.md`](architecture/components/admin-ui.md): the internal read-only operator dashboard.
- [`architecture/components/mlx-swift.md`](architecture/components/mlx-swift.md): the three pinned submodules (`mlx`, `mlx-swift`, `mlx-swift-lm`), what `MLXLMServer` is actually used for, and the source-matched `mlx.metallib`.
- [`architecture/routing.md`](architecture/routing.md): how a request becomes a provider choice — eligibility gates, cost model, selection, hedged dispatch, breakers.
- [`architecture/scheduling.md`](architecture/scheduling.md): per-model queues, slot states, token-budget admission, model swaps, warm pool, heartbeat and eviction.
